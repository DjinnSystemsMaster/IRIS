# Sullivan Channel

This repository contains code and documentation supporting the manuscript:
**"The Sullivan Channel: A Recursive Architecture for Coherence Preservation under Entropy in Learning Systems"** submitted to *Nature Machine Intelligence*.

## Summary
The Sullivan Channel introduces a novel recursion-based framework for preserving structural coherence in learning systems under entropy stress. Key mechanisms include Recursive Freeze-Lock and constraint-governed state transition logic.
